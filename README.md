[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://maiavelli-notetaker.herokuapp.com/)

A note taking application that uses express.js to let you write and save notes to help plan your day or remember whatever you wish. Once you finish your task, or no longer wish to have a note saved, you can delete the note! This application saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file and is deployed using Heroku.

My motivation when creating this project was to get familiar with express.js methods and Heroku, and also to further familiarize myself with working with server side data. 

## Usage 
To use this application, all you have to do is navigate to this webpage: https://maiavelli-notetaker.herokuapp.com/. Once there click 'Get Started' and you will be brought to a page where you can enter your notes and save them using the save button. Once a task is completed or a note is no longer needed, you can delete the note with the delete button.
